"""The CSV read and transform in the Spark DataFrame API, shared by LakeSail and Spark.

The notebook's `sail_clean_csv` up to (not including) the write. Sail speaks the Spark API over
Spark Connect and Spark speaks it natively, so one function serves both; the two engines differ
only in how they start a session and how they create the table.

THE PAD COLUMNS are the notebook's trick for a ragged file. A DISPATCHLOAD row has 53 fields but
other record types in the same file have up to ~130, and in PERMISSIVE mode a row with MORE
tokens than the schema is malformed and comes back as all nulls -- which would drop it BEFORE the
`I='D' AND UNIT='DUNIT'` filter could keep or discard it on its merits. Declaring `COL_54..COL_130`
as extra string columns gives every token a home; they are dropped right after the filter.
