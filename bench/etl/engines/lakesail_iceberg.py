"""LakeSail: read the CSVs from OneLake, write Iceberg through Sail's own catalog integration.

Port of the notebook's `sail_clean_csv`, the other engine there that already wrote Iceberg --
`df.write.mode("append").format("iceberg").partitionBy("YEAR").saveAsTable("sail")` after a
`create schema if not exists` and a `use schema`. Kept, minus the `partitionBy` (no engine here
partitions; bench/etl/iceberg.py says why), plus a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` first so every run
creates and fills a fresh table rather than appending to last run's.

The session is the TPC-H engine's:
`bench.interactive.engines.lakesail_iceberg.LakesailIceberg.setup()` starts the in-process
Spark Connect server with the OneLake catalog in `SAIL_CATALOG__LIST` and the storage token
in `AZURE_STORAGE_TOKEN`, which is what signs both the CSV reads and the
parquet writes. Everything that docstring says about the token's lifetime and the server
outliving the script applies here unchanged.
