"""The pyiceberg write path, for the engines that have no Iceberg writer of their own.

chDB and Polars produce a STREAM of Arrow record batches; in the notebook a Python library
(deltalake) turned that stream into a table. Here that library is pyiceberg 0.12, whose `append`
takes a `pa.RecordBatchReader` and microbatches it into files by `write.target-file-size-bytes`
-- so the engines stream, and nothing on this side holds more than one batch. Daft has its own
writer over a pyiceberg Table; DuckDB, Sail and Spark never come here.

UNPARTITIONED, ON PURPOSE, EVERY ENGINE. The notebook partitioned each table by `year`.
pyiceberg's streaming append is unpartitioned-only: a partitioned table takes a materialised
`pa.Table` (`NotImplementedError` on main as of 2026-09-18; the partitioned follow-up to
apache/iceberg-python#2152, PR #3336, was closed unmerged). A first version of this module
batched files to fit that, and 100 files of it took a 16 GB runner down (run 35548585688). So no
engine partitions -- the native writers dropped their `PARTITIONED BY` / `partitionBy` too, so
the seven tables are the same shape -- and `year` stays as a plain column, which is what every
transform produces anyway.

RECREATE, NOT OVERWRITE. Every run measures a fresh table: drop what the last run left, create,
append. pyiceberg's `overwrite` would keep the old snapshots and schema, and the schema is exactly
what may differ from run to run as an engine version changes what it infers.
