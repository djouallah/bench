"""Generate the suite's dataset into OneLake, once, before the matrix fans out.

THE SINGLE WRITER. Four matrix jobs calling generate() would race: `create_table_if_not_exists`
is check-then-act with a multi-minute window between the check and the `add_files` commit, so two
jobs can both decide the table is missing, both create it, and both register the same files. That
is a corrupt table, not a slow one. The fix is structural -- generation happens here, in a job
with no matrix, and the bench jobs are read-only.

WHICH SUITE is BENCH_SUITE's call (bench/suite.py). TPC-H generates with tpchgen-cli, TPC-DS with
DuckDB's dsdgen; both land the parquet the same way, through pyiceberg. Same marker, same
idempotency, two generators. TPCDS_REGENERATE=true (tpcds.yml's `regenerate` input) makes the
TPC-DS one purge the namespace and write it again.
