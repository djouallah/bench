"""PHASE 2: can this engine actually reach OneLake?

Runs only after smoke_sql.py has passed, and that ORDER IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Phase 1 proved the
engine speaks the dialect against local parquet. So anything that fails here is the catalog, the
credential, or the storage path -- never the SQL. The two questions never have to be untangled
from one log again.

IT CALLS THE ENGINE'S REAL setup(), not a copy of it. That is the code bench.yml runs, with the
same token, the same ATTACH, the same transport setting. A smoke test that reimplements the thing
it is testing proves nothing, and this repo has already paid for that lesson twice:

  * auth_smoke.py probe 4 checks pyiceberg's FileIO, which is adlfs -- a completely different
    HTTP stack from DuckDB's azure extension. It passed happily while DuckDB could not read one
    byte, and the benchmark then failed 44 times out of 44.
  * LakeSail's own logs said "vended storage credentials... not implemented yet" and carried on,
    so the attach succeeded and every query died on a credential built from the wrong env vars.

Then TWO queries, not the whole suite: the suite config's PROBE_QUERIES (TPC-H: Q1 scans lineitem
whole, Q6 scans it filtered; TPC-DS: Q3 and Q42 both scan store_sales). Either pair proves data
files are readable rather than merely listed -- which is the exact failure both bugs above
produced. Timing is printed but is NOT a result; publish never sees it.

NOT reusing auth_smoke.py's probes, deliberately: its probe 5 imports duckdb, and this job
installs only the engine under test.
